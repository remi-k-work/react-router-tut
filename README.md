# Router Contacts

Another day, another lesson ðŸ˜„ This time, I took the original instructions from React Router's website and tweaked them somewhat. This is a basic yet functional program for keeping track of your contacts. Do not be concerned; it stores all data locally in the browser using IndexedDB (local storage), so there should be no privacy problems. I added the option to generate some random contacts, and instead of pointing to a web URL, you may upload an avatar for each contact.
